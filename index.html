                        “create economic and social development from below”. Grameen Bank's objective since its
                        establishment in 1983 has been to grant poor people small loans on easy terms - so-called
                        micro-credit - and Yunus was the bank's founder.Later in 1998, Amartya Sen (born in British
                        India, now India) in Economics, in 2006 Muhammad Yunus (born in British India, now Bangladesh)
                        in Peace, and in 2019 Abhijit Banerjee (born in India), won this award in Economics.</p>
